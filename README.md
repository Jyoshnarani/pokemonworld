# pokemonworld

A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

This project is a Pokémon Details Viewer App that allows users to search for Pokémon, view detailed information about them, and enjoy animated transitions between different views. 
The app uses a combination of several popular Flutter libraries to manage network requests, display images efficiently, and handle connectivity status.

Users can search for specific Pokémon by name.

Once a Pokémon is selected, the app displays detailed information such as:

Basic Information: Name, type, HP, abilities, and stats.

Attacks: Moves and damage values.

Evolutions: Previous and next evolutions.

Set Information: Information like the card's rarity, release date, and more.

Animated transitions between screens or views (e.g., a smooth animation when navigating to the detailed view of a Pokémon).

The Pokémon data (such as stats, abilities, attacks, etc.) is fetched from a remote API using the Dio library.

Pokémon images (e.g., images of Pokémon cards or characters) are cached using the CachedNetworkImage library.
